        <h1> Happy Valentine's day sweety!</h1>
        <p>Every February 14th, candy, flowers, and gifts are exchanged between loved ones, all in the name of St. Valentine. But who is this mysterious saint and why do we celebrate this holiday?
        </p>
        <p>
        It all began in Rome, when the Emperor, Claudius II, was involved in many bloody and unpopular campaigns. “Claudius the Cruel” as he was called, was having a difficult time getting soldiers to join his military leagues. He believed that the reason was that Roman men <strong>did not want to leave their loves</strong> or families. So, he cancelled all marriages and engagements in Rome!
        </p>
        <p>
        The good Saint Valentine, who was a priest in Rome, in the year 269 A.D., together with his friend Saint Marius, defied Claudius and continued to <strong>perform marriages for young lovers</strong> in secret.
        When Valentine's actions were discovered, he was <strong>sentenced to be beaten to death </strong>with clubs and to have his head cut off.
        </p>
        <p>
        But while in prison, it is believed that Valentine <strong>fell in love with a young girl</strong>, who may have been his jailor's daughter, who visited him during his confinement. Before his death on the <strong>14th day of February</strong>, it is alleged that he wrote her a letter, which he signed
        </p>

        "From your Valentine"
